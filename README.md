# CompilerDesign
The assignments of Compiler Design at NCTU in 2020.
We implemented a compiler for P Language (professor designed).
The compiler included :
- a Scanner (hw1),
- a LALR(1) Parser (hw2),
- an Entended Parser to construct an AST (hw3),
- an Extended Parser to perform semantic analysis (hw4), 
- and a Code Generator for RISC-V instructions (hw5).
